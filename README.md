### Hi there 👋

I'm Rohan and have experience working in Software Development, Data Analysis and ML Model Building areas.

I like to learn new technologies related to ✳️ Data Science and ✳️ Machine Learning and try to continuously hone my skills in this field.

I work on projects and hackathons involving technologies like:

⚡ Python                                                                                                                                                
⚡ Tableau                                                                                                                                             
⚡ Advanced Excel                                                                                                                                                
⚡ Cloud (AWS / GCP / Azure / Heroku)
